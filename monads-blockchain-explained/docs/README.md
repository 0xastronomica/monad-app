# Monads in Blockchain Technology

Welcome to the "Monads in Blockchain Technology" project! This repository aims to explore the concept of monads and their application within the realm of blockchain technology. 

## Overview

Monads are a fundamental concept in functional programming that provide a way to structure computations. They allow for the chaining of operations while managing side effects, making them particularly useful in complex systems like blockchain.

In this project, we will delve into the following topics:

- **What are Monads?**: An introduction to the concept of monads, their properties, and how they function in programming.
- **Monads in Blockchain**: A discussion on how monads can be applied to model blockchain operations, enhancing the clarity and reliability of code.
- **Examples**: Practical implementations of monads in both TypeScript and Haskell, showcasing their utility in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can explore the following files:

- **Documentation**: Check the `docs` directory for detailed explanations and guides on monads and their relationship with blockchain technology.
- **Examples**: Look into the `src/examples` directory for TypeScript and Haskell implementations of simple monads.
- **Utilities**: The `src/utils` directory contains utility functions related to monads that can be reused across the project.
