# Haskell Examples for Monads in Blockchain

This README file provides guidance and examples for using Haskell in relation to monads, particularly in the context of blockchain technology.

## Overview

Monads are a fundamental concept in functional programming, providing a way to structure computations. In the context of blockchain technology, monads can help manage side effects, encapsulate state, and facilitate composition of operations.

## Haskell Monad Example

In the `toyMonad.hs` file, we provide a simple implementation of a monad in Haskell. This example demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a monad, including the `bind` and `return` operations.

### Key Concepts

- **Return**: This operation takes a value and wraps it in a monadic context.
- **Bind**: This operation takes a monadic value and a function that returns a monadic value, allowing for chaining operations.

## Running the Example

To run the Haskell example, ensure you have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) installed. You can compile and run the `toyMonad.hs` file using the following commands:

```bash
ghc toyMonad.hs
./toyMonad
```
