## Introduction

Monads are a powerful abstraction in functional programming that can help manage side effects, chaining operations, and maintaining state. In the context of blockchain technology, monads can be used to model transactions, state changes, and asynchronous operations, providing a clear and structured way to handle complex workflows.

## Getting Started

To get started with the TypeScript examples in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monads-blockchain-explained.git
   cd monads-blockchain-explained
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Examples**

   You can run the TypeScript examples using the following command:

   ```bash
   npx ts-node src/examples/ts/toy-monad.ts
   ```

## Examples

The `toy-monad.ts` file contains a simple implementation of a monad in TypeScript. It demonstrates the basic structure and functionality, including methods for binding and returning values. You can modify this file to experiment with different monadic operations and see how they can be applied to blockchain scenarios.

## Understanding Monads

For a deeper understanding of monads, refer to the `docs/monads.md` file, which explains their properties, types, and use cases. Additionally, the `docs/blockchain.md` file discusses how monads can be applied within the blockchain domain.

## Conclusion

This project aims to bridge the gap between functional programming concepts and blockchain technology through the lens of monads. By exploring these examples, you will gain insights into how monads can simplify complex operations and enhance the clarity of your code in blockchain applications.
